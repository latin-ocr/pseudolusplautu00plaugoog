’ ξ 8. 'llre Argument oi the Pseudolus is as follows: Calidonrs,
a wealr-minded but good-natured young Athenian, is in love

Ι with a flutegirl Phoenicium, at present in the possession oi a

pander Ballio. The latter had promised to give her ιο Calidorus
lor ao minae, which sum Calidorus is unable to raiser in spite
however ot' his promise Ballio is about to sell Phoenicium to a
certain meles who bas already paid ις minae: the remaining five
minae the miles, who is compelled to leave Athens, is to send
by one os his servants, who is at the same time to produce s
