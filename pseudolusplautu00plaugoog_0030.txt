Α Grammar is usually defined as the study oi certain linguistic .

phenomena, the morphology ol speech, in one languaget it in
more, it is comparative Grammar. These pheuomeua differ
(r) temporally, (a) locally, (y) according to the individual
speaker (stylism), ct eg. Thucydides, Cicero, Sophocles (eg. in
such phrases as μυρίον χρόνον). The temporal differences are
, the greatest, hence the axiom stated above, All true study ol lan·
guage must be ou the historical method. The great hindrance
to the adoption ol these principles lies in the preconceived no·
tions ol socalled Rsles, careiully {ostered by a continual diet
ol Cicero and Livy, and thc demands ol Latin Prose Com·
position. The word Rule is ton olten misitsed: ve talk ol ‘ai
rule ot' Latin Syntax,' whereas vve ought strictly to say that ‘at
such and such a time in such and such a place most Romans
expressed themselves in such and such s manner! That the
claims ot Historic grammar are recognized hy most scholars
nov is amply evidenced by the change in the point ol vievv lrom
which most modern grammars are written, a ,change which has
its ‘lons et principium' in Drdger's Historische Syntax der
Lateinischen Sprachc (rst Edit 1878). ·
