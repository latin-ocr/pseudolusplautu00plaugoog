appreciation oi this colloquial Latin always running parallel to
the more artificial latin ol the Augustan writers will prevent mis·

use oi that much-employed grammatical explanation ‘Grecism' -

which is often pressed too far, eg. with regard to the use of
the infinitive ln colloquial Latin the infinitive (a dative oi a
verbal noun) was used to denote the direction oi a movement,
the socalled final infinitiva, and oi this use Plautus, and in a
less degree Lucretius, give us several examples; it also occurs
in Vergil, Propertius (1. r. ra), Horace (Odes) and Ovid (Heroid.
t. 37), in all oi which writers it is not a ‘Grecism’ but a 'collo-
quialism? similarly in Old Latin the indicative is found in
indirect questions, ie therelation oi the question to the main
sentence is independent, a type which'goes baclr to a paratactic
original Cf. Plaut. Most 1172 viden ur adstat furcifer, etc.
But the indicative also occurs sporadically in the classical prose
writers, eg. Cie Att 1 a 18 utiles propinquitas quid haben· whilst
in Catullus, Vergil, and especially Propertius, it is comparatively
common, and the sermo pleber'us oi Petronius and Vitruvius
prefers the indicative. These instances again are mere col·
loquialisms, cf. the grammarian Diomedes (date 375 nn), who
commenting on nesciis quid sacis says eruditius enim ἄκων
‘nescrh quid sacriss¹,’ where nesah qm'd sacis represents the
ordinary usage oi popular Latin.

As Diez first shewed, it is from this popular Latin that the
Romance languages are derived, and as Plautus represents a
large linlr in the chain oi colloquial speech, his velue cannot be
too much insisted upon as serving to connect the study oi Latin
with that oi Modern Langrrages Τὴο first step towards under·
standing the development oi the Romance languages is to
reconstruct as lar as possible the popular Latin out oi which
they grewr Plautus’ contributions towards this are very larges ·
as shewn in more detail in the Appendix li it is not only from
his actual (i) colloquialisrns, but also (ii) his mette end (iii) his
spelling, thatwederive assistance ·
