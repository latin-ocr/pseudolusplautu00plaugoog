INTRODUCTION. 'xvii

representative of what may be called Old Latin: his position ln
the history of the latin language is very much that of Homer
for the Greek language, eg. his constructione are simplet, and
bis uses of words are nearer to the original meaning.

ii. Plautus’ language is colloquial, it represents the talkof ·

the common people at Rome, the ‘vorgsrspracne‘ as opposed to
the ‘Schriftsprache’ of the educated classes and littlrateurr.

iii. lt follows from the fact that Plautus' speech is colloquial
that it is also preeminentiy natural, untouched by stylisrn and
artificiality. The importance of realiring this in studying any
ianguage historically is evident Language is one of the many
ways of expressing thought: a prominent idea or relation of
ideas occurs in the thinker's mind which he wishes to express to
his hearer: the process is not thought out, except so far as is
necessary for clear expression: if the hearer understands, the

speaker has attained his object, even though the ‘linguistie . ’ ·⁸

expression of the psychie relation’ may be apparently‘ ungram·
maticaL’ language rs reasonable.

iv. The parallelo to Plautiae language are well· marked and

accessible' vra Cicero ιιι his letters, especially the Epistulae ad
Atticum, and Lucretius. Terence is only apparently parallel, as

a recent¹ writer on Latin grammar has shewn. The best idea
of the speech of the edocated upper classes at Rorne is derived
from a careful comparison of Terence with Plautus on the one
hand, on the other Cicero, for it is between these two that Terence
holds a middle place ς the literary circle in which Terence moved
made it their express object to polish and elaborate the Latin
language, and there isatouehof truth in Cicero’s tale that Laelius
was said to have written Terence’s plays3 for it was undoubtedly
to such men as laelius. and Scipio that Terence owed the
elegante of his style.
