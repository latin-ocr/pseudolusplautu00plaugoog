INTRODUCTIOM r'xr ¹
'ibe emsiu‘o or explanation ol the plot (tl 1-576) is un·

usually clear, and forms an excellem introduction to the fuller '

development ol the play iu 577-907, the Involutr'o. ln Act l.
Sc a <lt 133-253) where Pallio is addressing his slaves we
have a noticeable parallel to Sbalrespeare’s Pericles, Act tv.

As stated above, the orimnal oi tbe playis unknown ; most κ
probably Plautus made use oi more than one play in composing
tbe Pseudolum this we infer from the entire disappearance of
Callipho, from the great difference there is between the Simo
ol the last act and the Simo oi the turn thecook scene also
Act 111. Sc. a (794-907) seems to be taken in its entirely from

‘an original other than that oi the rest nithe play. Act lisca . ’ Ι

(dialogus, Pseudolus deceiving Harpax) is very Greek, as also
V. 1, where the dmulren Pseudolus expostulates with bis feet l
but the scene which is most Greek in content and phraseology
is 111. a, the conversation between Ballio and his new coolr.
The parts os the Pseudolus which seem most thoroughly Latin
and to be Plautus' own independent work are Act 1. (the
Expositis), ll. 3, Pseudolus on good lucit, and the second scene
oi Act V. (the conclusion os the picce); for in all of these may be
noted as latin characteristics (n) legal and military allusions,
(β) paucity oi Grecisms, (y) puna, paronomasia, plays on words,
(b) alliteration, rhyme, assonance Fors more detailed account
oi the application ot such criticism to Plautus’ plays vide Lotena, ·
