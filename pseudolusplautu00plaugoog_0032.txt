Historic guiumar, though etudied merely in its outlines,
should serve to emphasize turo points which boys at school are
apt not tograsp: theyare these:

Α. language is always moviny, always being evolve&

notes and Appendix B, is the conhirm’ty of colloquial Mn,
the fact that the talk of the common people at Rome, the ‘Vulpin-

the tyranny of ‘Cr'ceromimirmun’ though perhaps temporarily
obscured. Cicero himself recognizes the distinction between
written latin and colloquial latinu, as also do Quintilian,
isidorus of Seville und the later grammarians, cll of whom
